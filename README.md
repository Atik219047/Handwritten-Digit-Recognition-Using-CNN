Objective:
- The Handwritten Digit Recognition project aims to develop a machine learning model that accurately identifies and classifies handwritten digits (0-9) from images.

Overview:
- This project utilizes the well-known MNIST dataset, which consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits. The goal is to create an efficient classification system that can recognize digits effectively, serving as a foundational exercise in image classification techniques.

Workflow:

1. Data Acquisition: Access the MNIST dataset, which is crucial for handwritten digit recognition tasks and is readily available in libraries such as TensorFlow and Keras.
2. Data Exploration: Visualize sample images from the dataset to gain insights into the characteristics of handwritten digits and their variations.
3. Data Preprocessing: Normalize pixel values to a range of 0 to 1 and reshape the images as necessary. Split the dataset into training and testing sets for model evaluation.
4. Model Selection and Training: Implement classification algorithms, such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), Support Vector Machines (SVM), or fully connected neural networks, to train the model on the prepared data.
5. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix to quantify its effectiveness in recognizing handwritten digits.
